This organelle is green because of its chlorophyll (which absorbs sunlight), and in turn, because of this, most plants are green. For plants, the glucose produced by photosynthesis is used in cellular respiration, which is done by the mitochondria.</td>

The cell wall is different from the cell membrane as it cannot prevent things smaller than a certain size in.</td>

                            <td>The cell membrane protects the cell, and holds it together. The membrane is also a way for the cell to regulate what goes in and out of the cell. Because of how the membrane is constructed of interlocking hydrophobic lipids, it allows the cell to be waterproof.</td>

                            <td>When the ribosome leaves the nucleolus, it connects onto the rough endoplasmic reticulum to make proteins. In the rough ER, the protein is marked with a carbohydrate, so that the protein knows where to be sent. After this process, the protein is covered in a vesicle made of lipids to be sent out.</td>

                            <td>The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is similar to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. However, it does not have any ribosomes attached to it. The purpose of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is to store and produce lipids and steroids, use those same lipids and steroids to communicate with the rest of the cell, as well as detoxify the cell.</td>
